# UE-Jenkins-Engine

This repo contains build scripts for Unreal Engine. The build scripts are intended to be driven by [https://github.com/falldamagestudio.com/UE-Jenkins-BuildSystem](UE-Jenkins-BuildSystem).

The repo contains a submodule reference to the Unreal Engine source code. Since the UE source code is not open source, you will need to change the submodule ref to point to your own replica before building this.
